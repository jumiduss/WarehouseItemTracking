# WarehouseItemTracking
Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to optimize our work's receiving process and improve stock tracking

Knicked files are files pulled from a tool used to create the SVG file. In the process of editing these files I felt that a significant proportion of the code was redundant, and decided to write my own SVG file from scratch.

The aim of this project is to create a page that is able to:
Search a database of parts and their locations.
These locations will be highlighted on the SVG map.
Clicking the SVG map, you will have a table populate showing the items within the selected areas.
The search feature will auto-populate after a condition is met (such as typing in the correct characters to trigger a database query).
Finally, there will be an area to change locations/part names/add new parts/add new locations.

In a perfectly motivated world, I would integrate this with an ERP system that will add features to the system, and give my page other useful metrics, but I do not forsee a long stay after completing the first part of this project.
